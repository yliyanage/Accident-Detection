Many attempts have been made earlier in Accident  Detection projects  based on the help of various factors such as audio and video data. Like in many cases traffic surveillance video systems are used to as a source of data to make the detection algorithm work[1]. But in many cases it is seen that these video cameras are situated only in intersections of major freeways and highways with the given fact that the operator is most unlikely to focus on 10 to 15 screens efficiently which is there often resulting in loss of proper data[1]. Also mostly the traffic surveillance cameras are checked only when accidents are being reported from other sources which results in lack of accuracy[1]. Also video surveillance can be adversely affected in weather conditions such as snowfall, rainfall and fog[3]. Also some approaches have been made with detection of accident with only audio data like audio of car crashes or tire skidding  in road intersections which can prove to be faulty[3]. Mainly with audio signals it is classifies as ‘Crash’ or ‘non-crash[2]. However this system also doesn’t guarantee full accuracy as all type of crash sounds may not be related to car accidents. This can lead to faulty detections. Hence we have chosen to rely to the speed readings from the sensors which are located throughout the freeway and capturing the speed reading after specific interval of time thus resulting in more accuracy and retrieval of data throughout the highway or freeway and not only in intersections. Also the problems which persists with weather conditions is not relevant in our case.
