1. Speed Dataset:  We have created a big-dataset comprising of 1,446,196 speed readings collected from all 162 sensors.
  - Sampling time = 5 minutes
  - No. of missing samples = 140

2. Event Dataset:  We have created a dataset comprising details from all 1163 accidents happened. Details include:
  - Reported time of the accident
  - Duration of the accident
  - Accident location
  
  To handle missing data, we have used a liner-interpolation filter. 

# Data Processing and Visualizing
