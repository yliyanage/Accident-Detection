The data utilized in this study comprise freeway traffic data collected in realâ€“time. Specifically, we have access
to two sources of data: i) speed readings of loop sensors from several freeways covering a total of 41,236 miles in
California provided by the California Department of Transportation [3], and ii) reported accidents along the same
freeways provide by California Highway Patrol [4].
Speed Data: Sensors are located approximately every 0.5 miles along the freeway in both North and South
directions. For a given sensor, a speed reading is provided for each 5 minutes everyday, and includes details
such as sensor location, time and date of the speed reading, and freeway direction (i.e., North or South). Fig. 1
shows speed data from I405 freeway North direction observed at 8.45 am on 08th March 2020.
